## Your (optional) notes here!

## I would like to mention that I made some changes in Index.js file inside server folder. I Added some express changes for my route and cors, the reason for that lies in the fact that I could not be able to start frontend and serverside script with npm start command only as is written. First I got node version 14. I download higher version and do some aid with nodemon, but I couldnt be able to do it.

## So I separated my server on localhost:8080 as you mentioned and run my application in another terminal on another localhost. Header did not want to approve my request so I need to do Corse additional options for local request.

## All you need to do start frontend with npm start and in another terminal start server with node index.js command inside server directory.

## Additionally I added one more date for Jordan user to test my logic for sorting dates inside of working hours range. :)
