## Your (optional) notes here!

## I would like to mention that I made some changes in Index.js file inside server folder. I Added some express changes for my route and cors, the reason for that is I could not be able to start frontend and serverside script with npm start command only as is written. First I got node version 14, I download higher and do some aid with nodemon, but I couldnt be able to do it.

## So I separated my server on localhost:8080 as you mentioned and run my application in another terminal on localhost:3000. Header did not want to approve my request so I need to add Corse additional for local request.

## All you need to do is to start frontend with npm start and in another terminal start server with node index.js inside server directory :)
